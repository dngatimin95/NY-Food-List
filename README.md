# New York Food List

This repo scrapes both the Eater and The Infatuation websites for their monthly hot and essential recommended restaurants in New York City and then matched using the yelp api to gather their ratings, location and website etc. It is then compiled into a large excel file and sends them automatically to an email address which can be used for further analysis purposes. The idea is to create a constant update to notify me of new restaurants and places I should try.
