# New-Food-List

This repo scrapes both the Eater and The Infatuation websites for their monthly hot and essential recommended restaurants in New York City and then matched using the yelp api to gather their ratings, location and website etc. It is then compiled into a large excel file and sends them automatically to an email address which can be used for further analysis purposes. The idea is to create a constant update to notify me of new restaurants and places I should try. This is still a WIP and the recommending algorithm has yet to be implemented, which would recommend similar restaurants based on past restaurants. 

Due to COVID-19, Eater and The Infatuation has stopped updating their recommended lists. Thus, this project is suspended for now.
